# Analysis of Job Postings and H-1B Visa Approvals in the United States

This R-based project analyzes job postings and H-1B visa approval data to predict the likelihood that a job posting offers H-1B sponsorship. The model uses features such as job description, salary, employer name, and state to estimate sponsorship probability.

The analysis supports job seekers in identifying employers and locations more likely to offer H-1B sponsorship, helping them make data-driven career decisions. It also examines salary trends across states and industries, highlighting variations in compensation and labor market conditions.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation steps implemented in R. It was completed prior to recent updates to the H-1B sponsorship program, so results reflect conditions before those changes.
